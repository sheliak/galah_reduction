Database is available as a fits table or as a csv file. Fits table includes arrays, which are expanded in the csv file. For example, there is only one snr column in the fits table. Each entry is an array enclosing four values for four CCDs. In the csv database there are columns snr_1, snr_2, snr_3, snr_4 for blue, green, red, and IR CCDs. Csv file includes column names in the first line. Delimiter is a comma (,) and there are no commas in any strings in the table.

sobject_id	This number identifies an individual GALAH observation. It might stand for a single observation, continous observations combined into one spectrum or spectra combined over different epochs. sobject_id has a format of yymmddxxxxyyzzz. yy designates the year, mm the month and dd the day. xxxx is the exposure number. yy designates how the spectra were combined; 00 means this is a single observation, 01 means only consecutive exposures were combined, and 02 means all spectra from all epochs before and including yymmdd were combined, regardles which fibre they were observed with. zzz is the pivot designated to the observed star (pivot of the last observation if observations made with different fibre arangements were observed).
ra	Right ascension in decimal degrees as given in the .fld file (file used to configure fibres).
dec	Declination in decimal degrees as given in the .fld file (file used to configure fibres).
ra_icrs	Right ascension in decimal degrees from Gaia DR2. If there is no Gaia cross-match, this is set to 'None'.
dec_icrs	Declination in decimal degrees from Gaia DR2. If there is no Gaia cross-match, this is set to 'None'.
mjd	Modified UTC Julian date in the middle of the observation. If several observations are combined, the mjd is scalled with exposure times (but not with actual flux). Be careful when using mjd if observations over several epochs are combined.
utdate	Date and time in the middle of the observation given in ISO 8601 format in UTC. If several observations are combined, the utdate is scalled with exposure times (but not with actual flux). Be careful when using utdate if observations over several epochs are combined.
epoch	Decimal year in the middle of the observation in UTC. If several observations are combined, the epoch is scalled with exposure times (but not with actual flux). Be careful when using epoch if observations over several epochs are combined.
mjd_s	Same as mjd, but at the beginning of the first exposure.
utdate_s	Same as utdate, but at the beginning of the first exposure
epoch_s	Same as epoch, but at the beginning of the first exposure.
mjd_e	Same as mjd, but at the end of the first exposure.
utdate_e	Same as utdate, but at the end of the first exposure
epoch_e	Same as epoch, but at the end of the first exposure.
aperture	Number given to a spectrum in the image. There are always 392 apertures in each image (one for each fibre, excluding guiding fibres).
pivot	Number given to a fibre at the 2dF fibre positioner end of the fibre line. There are 400 pivots. This number is used in sobject_id.
fibre	Number given to a fibre at the spectrograph end of the fibre line. There are 400 fibres.
fibre_x	Position of the fibre on a 2dF fibre positioner plate in um.
fibre_y	Position of the fibre on a 2dF fibre positioner plate in um.
fibre_theta	Bending of the fibre away from the radial direction on a 2dF fibre positioner plate in decimal degrees.
plate	Plate in the primary focus of the 2dF fibre positioner.
aperture_position	Centre of the aperture in an image at column x=2000. If spectra from different epochs are combined the aperture_position is measured in the most recent image.
mean_ra	Right ascension of the telescope pointing in decimal degrees.
mean_dec	Declination of the telescope pointing in decimal degrees.
mean_zd	Zenith distance of the telescope pointing in decimal degrees.
mean_airmass	Airmass calculated as sec(mean_zd).

cfg_field_name	Name of the field as given in the cfg_file.
obj_name	Name of the object as given in the cfg_file (in the .fld file).
galah_id	Identifier unique to a star used internally in GALAH. Must be given as an obj_name in the cfg_file in a format galahic_xxxxxxxxx.
2mass_id	2MASS identifier. This is obtained from a simple cross-match using (ra,dec) only. Limiting distance is 3 arcsec.
gaia_id	Gaia EDR3 source ID. This is obtained from a simple cross-match using (ra,dec) only. Limiting distance is 2 arcsec and stars with G<17 are considered.
snr	Mean signal to noise ratio per pixel. Is an array with four numbers for blue, green, red and IR ccds.
snr_AA	Mean signal to noise ratio per Angstrom. Is an array with four numbers for blue, green, red and IR ccds.
fibre_throughput	Fibre throughput measured relative to the most transparent fibre in each COB. Most transparent fibre has throughput=1.
telluric_h2o	Density of absorptions of water vapor in the atmosphere. This is a scalling factor with which the HITRAN spectrum is multiplied during telluric absorption removal. Value for blue CCD is assumed to be the same as for IR CCD, as telluric absorptions in blue are miniscule and not possible to fit.
telluric_o2	Density of absorptions of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. This is a scalling factor with which the HITRAN spectrum is multiplied during telluric absorption removal. Values for red and blue CCDs are 'NULL', because there are no oxygen absorption lines there.
res	Mean resolution given as FWHM of the LSF in Angstroms.  Is an array with four numbers for blue, green, red and IR ccds.
b_par	B parameter used to define the LSF. Is an array with four numbers for blue, green, red and IR ccds. B parameter is a constant for each spectrum in each ccd.
v_bary_eff	Effective barycentric velocity correction in km/s. This correction is already applied to all spectra. It is calculated for time mjd.
exposed	Total exposure time of all combined spectra in seconds.
mag	Magnitude as given in the cfg_file.
e_b-v	Color excess E(B-V) in magnitudes. This is the terminal color excess (as it would appear for objects far away). Real color excess for the observed star is expected to be lower than the given value. Parameter is queried from Planck maps.
wav_rms	RMS of the wavelength calibration. Is an array with four numbers for blue, green, red and IR ccds. If spectra from different epochs are combined, only the worst RMS is given.

reduction_flags	Flags in a binary mask format. See flags_description.txt for explanation.
