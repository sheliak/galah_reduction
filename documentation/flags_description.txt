Description of reduction flags given in field ``reduction_flags''.

Bit	Decimal value	Description
0	+1	Trace/aperture/tramline in blue CCD failed to fit*
1	+2	Trace/aperture/tramline in green CCD failed to fit*
2	+4	Trace/aperture/tramline in red CCD failed to fit*
3	+8	Trace/aperture/tramline in IR CCD failed to fit*
4	+16	Bad wavelength solution in blue CCD
5	+32	Bad wavelength solution in green CCD
6	+64	Bad wavelength solution in red CCD
7	+128	Bad wavelength solution in IR CCD
8	+256	Cross-talk in blue CCD is large, probably didn't fit properly
9	+512	Cross-talk in green CCD is large, probably didn't fit properly
10	+1024	Cross-talk in red CCD is large, probably didn't fit properly
11	+2048	Cross-talk in IR CCD is large, probably didn't fit properly
12	+4096	Radial velocity in blue CCD could not be calculated**
13	+8192	Radial velocity in green CCD could not be calculated**
14	+16384	Radial velocity in red CCD could not be calculated**
15	+32768	Radial velocity in IR CCD could not be calculated**
16	+65536	Radial velocity could not be calculated from the combination of all four CCDs**
17	+131072	Atmospheric parameters could not be calculated


*A trace that didn't fit correctly might still produce useful spectra. Although it usually won't have cross-talk calculated properly.
**In this case the radial velocity can be None/NULL or have some value. If the flag is raised, the value is very unreliable, if it exists.
