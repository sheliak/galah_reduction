Bit	Decimal value	Description
0	+1	Trace/aperture/tramline in blue CCD failed to fit*
1	+2	Trace/aperture/tramline in green CCD failed to fit*
2	+4	Trace/aperture/tramline in red CCD failed to fit*
3	+8	Trace/aperture/tramline in IR CCD failed to fit*
4	+16	Bad wavelength solution in blue CCD
5	+32	Bad wavelength solution in green CCD
6	+64	Bad wavelength solution in red CCD
7	+128	Bad wavelength solution in IR CCD
8	+256	Radial velocity in blue CCD could not be calculated
9	+512	Radial velocity in green CCD could not be calculated
10	+1024	Radial velocity in red CCD could not be calculated
11	+2048	Radial velocity in IR CCD could not be calculated
12	+4096	Radial velocity could not be calculated from the combination of all four CCDs
