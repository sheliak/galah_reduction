# How to run the pipeline

**1. RUNNING COMPLETE REDUCTION PIPELINE**

To reduce one night run
```
python extract6.0.py /path/to/spectra/night
```
where /path/to/spectra/night is a path to standard GALAH folders for one night. Inside this folder should be folders comments, data, fld, sds, etc. When testing, make a copy of data in case it gets corrupted. The reduction pipeline should make a local copy and not write anything into /path/to/spectra/night.

**2. PARTIAL REDUCTION**

Reduction steps that will be performed are listed at the end of extract6.0.py. If only some steps are performed, the reduction can be run again with only the remaining steps. This is most useful for testing. so you don't have to run the whole pipeline every time.
