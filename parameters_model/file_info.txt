In this folder we have all files that are need for running a predetermined (convolutional) neural network that will determine stellar parameters and abundances from the input spectra.

Files that are needed by the procedure:
model_nn.h5 - Keras neural network model that contains architecture of the model, internal weights, training configuration and state of the optimizer
model_wvl.dat - wavelength bins that are used in the model_nn
model_norm.pkl - values of mean and sigma used for the normalisation of output parameters 
model_out.dat - ordered list of parameters produced by the network
