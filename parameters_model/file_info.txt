In this folder we have all files that are need for running a predetermined (convolutional) neural network that will determine stellar parameters and abundances from the input spectra.

Files that are needed by the procedure:
model_nn.json - Keras neural network model that contains architecture of the model
model_nn_weights.h5 - Weights of the trained model
model_wvl.dat - Wavelength bins that are used in the model_nn
model_norm.pkl - Values of mean and sigma used for the normalisation of output parameters
model_out.dat - Ordered list of parameters produced by the network
